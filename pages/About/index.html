    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>Rex Printing Company, Inc. (RPCI) is a subsidiary of the Rex Group of Companies, dedicated to providing quality printing services on-demand through our diverse portfolio of custom digital and offset printing services.</p>
    <p>We, as a company,  started operations in 1973, primarily responding to the printing requirements of our sister companies, Rex Book Store, Inc. (now Rex Education) and Rex Publications, Inc. During that same year, the Rex Commercial Division was also organized. Throughout the years, while we continue to serve the printing requirements of Rex Education, we expanded our reach and horizon—we started offering full printing services to external clients, including institutional partners, starting from pre-press all the way to post-press. Rex Printing has consistently delivered high-quality printed materials and affordable printing services to countless happy clients. Our reliability, flexibility, and friendly service make us the preferred partner for all kinds of printing needs—from printed literature, such as books and magazines, to other paraphernalia like notebooks, brochures, business cards, among others.</p>
